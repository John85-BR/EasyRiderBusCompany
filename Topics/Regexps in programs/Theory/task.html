<p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9468" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, describing a set of strings. | Regular expressions are used for searching and editing text, replacing one substring with another, and so on. They are versatile and can automate many tedious text-related tasks, such as input text validation or data collection. Regular expressions can match a variety of character patterns. For instance, they can match exactly one character in the string but define a whole number of characters that can match it. These characters are listed inside the square bracket. For example, in the template [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+, the set [a-zA-Z0-9] corresponds to any alphanumeric character, while the set [._%+-] corresponds to any of the characters ., %, +, or -. It is worth noting that an unescaped left square bracket, for which no unescaped right square bracket is found, will cause an error. However, there is almost no need for boring escaping stuff when using sets in regular expressions.">Regular expressions</a> are very versatile. They can be used to automate many tedious text-related tasks, such as input text validation or data collection. In this topic, we will have a look at two examples of simple yet powerful programs that employ regular expressions.</p>
<h5 id="email-validation-program">Email validation program </h5>
<p>Let's have a look at a basic program that checks whether the text contains email addresses and, if it does, returns them in sequential order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import re

def find_emails(string):
    # Here we compile our simple pattern that will match email addresses
    pattern = re.compile(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+')

    # Remember that re.findall() returns a list of all matched email strings
    emails = re.findall(pattern, string) 

    # To print the matched strings one by one
    for email in emails:
        print(email)</code></pre>
<p>The program above carries out a rather simple check. It checks if the <code class="language-python">@</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10355" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a character is represented as a string, which is a sequence of Unicode characters. | Characters are not just any characters, but are unicode characters. Python introduced a new data type, `str`, which has a twofold nature: it represents a string that is easily understandable by a human reader, while also being in a form that makes it suitable for processing by the computer. Python provides functions such as `ord()` and `chr()` for converting Unicode characters to their respective code points and vice versa. When comparing two strings, the comparison is performed between the corresponding characters of each string, continuing until some respective characters are found not to be equal or until one or both of the strings end. Python's `str` data type can represent strings as a sequence of numbers, which is important because computers don't understand Unicode or letters and symbols used by humans. To store and process information, computers need it to be in numeric form. The `str` data type is used to represent strings as a sequence of numbers, and this data type is called a character. Additionally, strings can contain a certain type of character, such as punctuation marks, digits, or uppercase English alphabet. The `string` module in Python employs ASCII characters only, which is one of the character encoding standards used in electronics.">character</a> is preceded and followed by alphanumeric characters, an underscore, and a dot. Mind that <code class="language-python">\w</code> is equal to <code class="language-python">[A-Za-z0-9_]</code>.</p>
<p>Let's test our program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Suppose we have a text with various email addresses
string = '''cat billy123@something.com, dog 456 
          alice_2000@website.com johnnY.b@blahblahblah.com'''
find_emails(string)
# billy123@something.com
# alice_2000@website.com
# johnnY.b@blahblahblah.com
</code></pre>
<p>The downside is that our program will also match strings like <code class="language-python">_@._</code>. They obviously cannot be considered email addresses. </p>
<h5 id="email-validation-20">Email validation 2.0</h5>
<p>If usernames and domain names are too short, it may lead to rather bad scenarios. We can set some restrictions when compiling our pattern to avoid this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Let's say we want the username to be at least 5 characters long 
# and the domain name of 2 to 4 characters 
pattern = re.compile(r'[\w\.-]{5,}@[\w-]+\.\w{2,4}')</code></pre>
<p>Let's break it down piece by piece:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-python">[\w\.-]{5,}</code> matches alphanumeric characters, underscores, a dot, or a dash that appear at least 5 times;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">@</code> matches the <strong>@<em> </em></strong>sign;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">[\w-]+\.</code> matches alphanumeric characters, underscores, or a dash followed by a dot;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">\w{2,4}</code> matches alphanumeric characters and underscores that appear 2-4 times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's our final program: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def find_emails(string):
    # Here we compile our simple pattern that will match email addresses
    pattern = re.compile(r'[\w\.-]{5,}@[\w-]+\.[\w]{2,4}')

    # Remember that re.findall() returns a list of all matched email strings
    emails = re.findall(pattern, string) 

    # To print the matched strings one by one
    for email in emails:
        print(email)</code></pre>
<p>Let's test it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">string = '''_@._ mary_liu@abc._ billy123@something.com, dog 456 
            alice_2000@website.com johnnY.b@blahblahblah.com one@one.one'''
find_emails(string)
# billy123@something.com
# alice_2000@website.com
# johnnY.b@blahblahblah.com</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, simple restrictions can make our pattern more powerful. You can also make your pattern match more specific strings by, for example, adding the boundary shorthands <code class="language-python">\b</code> at the beginning and the end of the pattern, as well as lookaround assertions. </p>
<h5 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h5>
<p>As you may already know, text preprocessing plays a crucial role with textual data. <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15487" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, tokenization is the process of splitting a text into smaller units, typically words, to facilitate text processing. | A straightforward approach to tokenization is to split a text by whitespaces. However, this method may not always be sufficient, as it can result in incorrect tokenization of words containing punctuation marks. To address this issue, regular expressions can be used to create more powerful patterns that consider specific punctuation marks and other features. The choice of tokenization method depends on the type of text being dealt with.">Tokenization</a> or splitting text into smaller units (usually words) is the first step in text processing. Text tokenization can go smoother with regular expressions if you don't want to use other special tools. </p>
<p>The most straightforward approach to tokenization is to split a text by whitespaces. Let's see how it works: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import re

def tokenize(string):
    tokens = re.split('\s+', string)
    return tokens

string = "This is a sample string. (And here's another one!!)"
tokenize(string)
# ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'string.', '(And', "here's", 'another', 'one!!)']</code></pre>
<p>After giving it a thorough look, you can spot the elephant in the room â€” punctuation marks. Let's get rid of them before we split our sentence:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import re

def tokenize(string):
    # Let's create a pattern that contains punctuation marks
    punctuation = re.compile(r'[\.,\?!\*:;()]')

    # Substitute the punctuations with empty strings
    no_punct = re.sub(punctuation, '', string)
    print(no_punct)
    # This is a sample string And here's another one

    # Split sentences by whitespaces
    tokens = re.split('\s+', no_punct)
    return tokens

tokenize(string)
# ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'string', 'And', "here's", 'another', 'one']</code></pre>
<p>We have not omitted the apostrophe <code class="language-python">'</code> in the punctuation mark list. This is quite important as we do not want to split words like <code class="language-python">Let's</code>, <code class="language-python">here's</code>, or <code class="language-python">Mary's</code> into two different tokens and change their meaning. </p>
<p>As you can see, tokenization can be a bit tricky, but regex can help you with it. Of course, there are a lot of ways to tokenize a text depending on the text type you are dealing with. We have presented you with one of the simplest ways to do it. </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we've seen examples of how regular expressions can help us with string processing. You can experiment further and implement other regular expressions to check whether a string is a valid email address or tokenize more complicated sentences. </p>
<p>To sum up, even simple regular expression patterns can be used to write powerful programs for real-life applications, including textual data extraction and substitution, web scraping, and many other natural language processing tasks. </p>
