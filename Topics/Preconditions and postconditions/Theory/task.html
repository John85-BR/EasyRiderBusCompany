<p>When designing your <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9468" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, describing a set of strings. | Regular expressions are used for searching and editing text, replacing one substring with another, and so on. They are versatile and can automate many tedious text-related tasks, such as input text validation or data collection. Regular expressions can match a variety of character patterns. For instance, they can match exactly one character in the string but define a whole number of characters that can match it. These characters are listed inside the square bracket. For example, in the template [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+, the set [a-zA-Z0-9] corresponds to any alphanumeric character, while the set [._%+-] corresponds to any of the characters ., %, +, or -. It is worth noting that an unescaped left square bracket, for which no unescaped right square bracket is found, will cause an error. However, there is almost no need for boring escaping stuff when using sets in regular expressions.">regular expression</a> patterns, you can use <strong>lookaround assertions </strong>to make your patterns match specific strings that follow or precede another pattern. Lookaround assertions are enclosed in parentheses; they do not return the matched pattern. That's why we can also call them <strong>zero-width assertions</strong>. We will look at them in more detail in the following sections.</p>
<h5 id="positive-lookaheads">Positive lookaheads</h5>
<p>The first type of assertion that we are going to discuss is the <strong>positive lookahead</strong>. It is a regexp pattern that looks as <code class="language-python">(?=pattern)</code>.<br/>Patterns with a positive lookahead match the pattern to the right side of the target match. For example, <code class="language-python">JetBrains (?=Academy)</code> will match <code class="language-python">JetBrains</code> only if <code class="language-python">Academy</code> follows it. Let's have a look at how they work in the code snippet below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pattern = r'JetBrains (?=Academy)'
string_1 = 'JetBrains Academy'
string_2 = 'JetBrains Company'
 
result_1 = re.match(pattern, string_1)  # match 
result_2 = re.match(pattern, string_2)  # no match</code></pre>
<h5 id="negative-lookaheads">Negative lookaheads</h5>
<p>A <strong>negative lookahead </strong>is a regexp pattern that takes the form of <code class="language-python">(?!pattern)</code>. It does completely the opposite: patterns with a negative lookahead return a match if a pattern defined in parentheses doesn't follow a string. In our example, <code class="language-python">JetBrains (?!Academy)</code> will return a match only if <code class="language-python">JetBrains</code> is not followed by <code class="language-python">Academy</code>. Compare the results below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pattern = r'JetBrains (?!Academy)'
string_1 = 'JetBrains Academy'
string_2 = 'JetBrains Company'
 
result_1 = re.match(pattern, string_1)  # no match 
result_2 = re.match(pattern, string_2)  # match</code></pre>
<h5 id="positive-lookbehinds">Positive lookbehinds</h5>
<p>A <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6189" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a positive lookbehind is a type of regex pattern that matches a string only if the specified phrase precedes it. | It is expressed as (?&lt;=\&lt;phrase\&gt;) where &lt;phrase&gt; is the pattern that you want to check for. It's important to note that a positive lookbehind pattern can only match strings of fixed length, meaning you can use patterns like (?&lt;=\d\d) or (?&lt;=\b\w{4}\b), but not (?&lt;=\w+), as the length of the matched string can vary. Additionally, a pattern starting with a positive lookbehind assertion does not match the beginning of a string, so it's recommended to use it carefully.">positive lookbehind</a></strong> assertion pattern is an expression like this: <code class="language-python">(?&lt;=pattern)</code>. In the same way as the positive lookahead, a positive lookbehind matches a string if the specified phrase precedes it. In our <code class="language-python">(?&lt;=JetBrains )Academy</code> example, <code class="language-python">Academy</code> is the output. Mind the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pattern = '(?&lt;=JetBrains )Academy'
string =  'JetBrains Academy'

result = re.search(pattern, string)
print(result.group())  # Academy</code></pre>
<p>There are two crucial things to account for if you opt for positive lookbehinds:</p>
<ul><li><p>A positive lookbehind pattern can only match strings of <strong>fixed length</strong>. In other words, you can use patterns like <code class="language-python">JetBrains</code> or <code class="language-python">[Jet |Brains ]</code>, but you cannot use <code class="language-python">\w+</code>, <code class="language-python">JetBrains{1, }</code>, or <code class="language-python">JetBrains.*</code>, as their length can vary. Similar patterns with positive lookbehinds raise an error:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">pattern = '(?&lt;=JetBrains.*)Academy'
string = 'JetBrains Academy'

result = re.search(pattern, string)
print(result.group())  # ...re.error: look-behind requires fixed-width pattern</code></pre>
<ul><li><p>Patterns that start with positive lookbehind assertions do not match the beginning of a string<em>. </em>We recommend using the <code class="language-python">search()</code> method instead of <code class="language-python">match()</code> if you want your pattern to match the beginning of a string:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">result_1 = re.match('(?&lt;=JetBrains )Academy', 'JetBrains Academy')  # None
result_2 = re.search('(?&lt;=JetBrains )Academy', 'JetBrains Academy')  # 'Academy'</code></pre>
<h5 id="negative-lookbehinds">Negative lookbehinds</h5>
<p>The last assertion that we are going to look at is the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10142" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a negative lookbehind is a type of regex pattern that matches a string only if it is not preceded by a specific pattern. | It is an assertion that checks the preceding text, but does not include it in the match. Negative lookbehinds are useful for excluding certain matches. For example, the pattern (?&lt;!foo)bar would match bar only if it is not preceded by foo. It is important to note that the length of the lookbehind pattern must be fixed, meaning that you cannot use quantifiers such as * or + within a negative lookbehind.">negative lookbehind</a></strong><em>. </em>You can define it as <code class="language-python">(?&lt;!pattern)</code>. Negative lookbehind matches a string if the current position in the string is not preceded by the match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pattern = r'(?&lt;!JetBrains )Academy'
string_1 = 'JetBrains Academy'
string_2 = 'Hyperskill Academy'

re.search(pattern, string_1)  # None
re.search(pattern, string_2)  # Academy</code></pre>
<p>Similar to the positive lookbehind, the negative lookbehind pattern matches only strings of <em>fixed length</em>. Also, patterns starting with negative lookbehind assertions <em>don’t match the beginning of a string</em>, so avoid using <code class="language-python">match()</code>.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have covered simple but useful regex tools called lookaround assertions. Let’s recap:</p>
<ul><li><p>Positive lookahead <code class="language-python">(?=pattern)</code> provides a match if the text is followed by the specified pattern;</p></li><li><p>Negative lookahead <code class="language-python">(?!pattern)</code> provides a match if the text is not followed by the specified pattern;</p></li><li><p>Positive lookbehind <code class="language-python">(?&lt;=pattern)</code> provides a match if the text is preceded by the pattern;</p></li><li><p>Negative lookbehind <code class="language-python">(?&lt;!pattern)</code> provides a match if the text is not preceded by the pattern;</p></li><li><p>Lookbehind assertions do not match the beginning of a string, so prefer <code class="language-python">search()</code> over <code class="language-python">match()</code>;</p></li><li><p>Lookbehind patterns work with fixed-length strings only.</p></li></ul>
